1.For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50
people table schema

    id
    name
    age

You should return all people fields where their age is over 50 and order by the age descending.

Solution:
SELECT * FROM people WHERE age > 50 ORDER BY age DESC;

2. Messi goals function

Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:

    LaLiga
    Copa del Rey
    Champions

Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.

Note: 
the input will always be valid.
the result must return the total of goals for each row.

For example:

row1 5, 10, 2  -->  17
row2 0,0,1 --> 1

Solution:

This is only my model used to get the final solution:

create TABLE goles(
  la_liga_goals int,
  copa_del_rey_goals,
  champions_league_goals
 
);

INSERT into goles('la_liga_goals','copa_del_rey_goals','champions_league_goals')  VALUES (0,0,0);
INSERT into goles('la_liga_goals','copa_del_rey_goals','champions_league_goals')  VALUES (43,10,5);

query:
SELECT 
	(la_liga_goals+ copa_del_rey_goals+champions_league_goals) as "res"
FROM goals;
